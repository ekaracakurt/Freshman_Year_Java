# Freshman_Year_Java
Java projects that I've done during my education.
I will be publishing the things that I'm doing to see my self development. <br><strong><em> Projects are in the files that I create in this repository.</em></strong>
<br>Feel free to inspect them, and maybe use them in your own projects, but <strong><em>please don't use in academic things and don't plagiarise it to do your homework.</em></strong>
Thank you!
