# Freshman_Year_Java
Java projects that I've done during my education.
I will be publishing the things that I'm doing to see my self development, in the branches that I create in this repository.
Feel free to inspect them, and maybe use them in your own projects, but please don't use in academic things and plagiarise it to do your homework.
Thank you!
